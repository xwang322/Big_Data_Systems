This part we develop the codes for structured streaming. 
If you want to run the code, first run streaming-emulator.sh in /home/ubuntu/grader. This will transfer files from hdfs /staging to /monitoring. 
After this is running, run which question you like in Part-B, we set the question1 and 3 for console display at 200 which is larger than 20 default setting. 
For question 2, the result is written to /PartB-Question2-result in hdfs in parquet format, the filename is randomly generated.
If you want to cat what is inside, you need to download the file to local file system and rename to whatever name you perfer plus .parquet as postscript.
Then open pyspark and type in spark.read.parquet(filename.parquet).show()
